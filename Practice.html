    ==> OBJECT PROPERTY <==

    1. WHAT IS OBJECT? (TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE)
    2. 2 WAYS TO CREATE AN OBJECT. (DIRECT AND USING NEW KEYWORD)
    3. WHAT OBJECT CONTAINS? (PROPERTIES AND METHODS)
    4. REPRESENTATION OF PROPERTIES. (DOT NOTATION AND ARRAY NOTATION)
    5. CAMEL CASE AND SNAKE CASE.
    6. CRUD OPERATIONS OF PROPERTIES IN OBJECT.


    ==> OBJECT METHOD <==

    7. WHAT IS METHOD OF AN OBJECT? (FUNCTION ASSOCIATED WITH AN OBJECT)
    8. 4 WAYS TO DEFINE THE OBJECT METHODS.


    ==> OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR <==

    9. WHY USER SHOULD SHIFT FROM OBJECT TO OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR? (TIDIOUS TASK AND REPEATATION)
    10. CREATE CONSTRUCTOR USING THIS KEYWORD. (CONSTRUCTOR CAN CREATE USING FUNCTION LIKE A METHOD)
    11. FIRST LATER OF OF CONSTRUCTOR NAME (FUNCTION) SHOULD BE CAPITAL TO DIFFERENCIATE WITH NORMAL FUNCTION.
    12. CREATE AN OBJECT USING ITS CONSTRUCTOR: OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR CALLING
    13. CRUD OPERATIONS IN OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR.
    14. METHOD FROM SPECIFIC OBJECT CAN ALSO BE REMOVE USING DELETE KEYWORD.
    15. OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR IS FULLY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS KEYWORD. (THIS.PROPERTY_NAME)
    16. HOW YOU CAN ADD STATIC PROPERTY EXTERNALLY INTO OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR. 
    (THIS.NATIONALITY = "INDIAN")


    ==> OBJECT PROTOTYPE <==

    17. PROTOTYPE IS A SUPER CLASS AND ITSELF IS AN OBJECT.
    18. EVERY OTHER CLASSES AND FUNCTION CONTAINS PROTOTYPE BYDEFAULT.
    19. IT IS LIKE A CHAIN, PROTOTYPE ITSELF CONTAINS SUB PROTOTYPE INSIDE IT.
    20. NEED OF PROTOTYPE: WE CAN ADD PROPERTIES AND METHODS TO AN OBJECT EXTERNALLY. (NOT INSIDE AN OBJECT AND NOT INSIDE THE CONSTRUCTOR)
    21. ADDING METHODS INTO OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR IS NOT POSSIBLE USING 3RD AND 4TH WAY BECAUSE WE ARE ADDING IT EXTERNALLY. (NOT INSIDE THE OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR)
    22. TO ADD (PROPERTY OR METHOD) INTO AN OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR, WE CANNOT ADD ANYTHING DIRECTLY TO AN OBJECT EXTERNALLY.
        EX: CONSTRUCTOR_NAME.PROTOTYPE.PROPERTY_NAME = "VALUE"; // FOR PROPERTY
        EX: CONSTRUCTOR_NAME.PROTOTYPE.METHOD_NAME = FUNCTION_NAME; // FOR METHOD: 1ST WAY (NORMAL FUNCTION)
    23. ADDED PROPERTIES AND METHODS INTO AN OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR IS NOT DIRECTLY DISPLAY INTO THE OBJECT, IT DISPLAYS INTO PROTOTYPE SECTION INSIDE THE OBJECT.
