<!-- 
    BOM: BROWSER OBJECT MODEL.

    ==> BOM IS USED TO INTERACT WITH THE BROWSER THROUGH JAVASCRIPT.

    ==> MAIN OBJECT OF BOM IS : WINDOW OBJECT

    ==> WINDOW OBJECT REPRESENTS THE WINDOW IN BROWSER. 

    ==> WINDOW OBJECT (OF ANY WEBSITE) IS CREATED BY BROWSER AUTOMATICALLY.

    ==> WINDOW IS DEFAULT OBJECT OF BROWSER, WE DO NOT NEED TO WRITE IT WHILE USING PROPERTY AND A METHOD.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------

    ==> ALL "GLOBAL" JAVASCRIPT'S 
            1. OBJECTS, 
            2. FUNCTIONS,
            3. VARIABLES WITH VAR KEYWORD ONLY (NOT LET AND CONST)
            4. DEFAULT METHODS (ALERT, CONFIRM, PROMT)
        AUTOMATICALLY BECOME THE MEMBER OF THE WINDOW OBJECT.

    ==> "GLOBAL VARIABLES" (USING VAR) ARE THE "PROPERTIES" OF THE WINDOW OBJECT.

    ==> "GLOBAL FUNCTIONS" ARE THE "METHODS" OF THE WINDOW OBJECT.

    ==> "GLOBAL OBJECTS" ARE THE "SUB OBJECTS" OF THE WINDOW OBJECT.

    ==> ONLY VAR KEYWORD WILL BECOME THE PROPERTY OF WINDOW OBJECT, LET AND CONST WON'T.

    ==> 'LET' AND 'CONST' WILL BE "UNDEFINED" IF CALL IT USING WINDOW OBJECT.
