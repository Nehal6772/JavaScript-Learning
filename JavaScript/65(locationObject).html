<!-- 
    ==> LOCATION IS THE SUB OBJECT OF WINDOW OBJECT.

    => USAGE OF LOCATION OBJECT:

        1) LOCATION OBJECT IS USED TO GET THE ADDRESS (URL) OF CURRENT PAGE.

        2) IT IS ALSO USED TO REDIRECT THE BROWSER FROM ONE URL TO ANOTHER URL.

    ==> IF WE USE LOCATION OBJECT, WE DO NOT NEED TO DEFINE IT USING WINDOW OBJECT BECAUSE WINDOW OBJECT IS DEFAULT.

        EX: window.location.href // NO NEED TO DEFINE LOCATION USING WINDOW OBJECT.
        => location.href // THIS IS VALID WITHOUT WINDOW OBJECT.

    ==> LOCATION OBJECT HAS FEW PROPERTIES AND FEW METHODS:

    ==> REDIRECT CURRENT WEB PAGE TO GIVEN URL: WE HAVE 4 WAYS. 

        1) window.location: (property)
            => window.location = "https://www.google.com"; 

        2) location.href: (property)
            => location.href = "https://www.google.com"; 

        3) location.assign("URL"): (method)
            => location.assign("https://www.google.com"); // (BACK BUTTON ENABLE)

        4) location.replace("URL"); (method)    
            => location.replace("https://www.google.com"); // (BACK BUTTON DISABLE)

        ==> ALL THESE REDIRECTS WILL BE STORED IN THE BROWSER HISTORY.

    -------------------------------------------------

    ==> METHOD OF LOCATION OBJECT.

        1) location.assign("URL"); 
            => REDIRECT TO GIVEN URL 
            => CURRENT PAGE WILL BE STORED IN SESSION HISTORY (THAT'S WHY BACK BUTTON WILL BE THERE)
            => USER HAVE BACK BUTTON TO GO TO PREVIOUS PAGE ONCE IT IS DIRECTED TO GIVEN URL
            => STORED IN BROWSER HISTORY

        2) location.replace("URL");
            => SAME AS ASSIGN() : REDIRECT TO GIVEN URL
            => CURRENT PAGE WILL NOT BE STORED IN SESSION HISTORY (THAT'S WHY NO BACK BUTTON WILL BE THERE)
            => USER WILL NOT HAVE BACK BUTTON TO GO TO PREVIOUS PAGE ONCE IT IS DIRECTED TO GIVEN URL
            => STORED IN BROWSER HISTORY

        3) location.reload(); 
            => RELOAD THE PAGE
            => SAME AS REFRESH BUTTON
